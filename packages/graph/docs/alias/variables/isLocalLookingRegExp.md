# Variable: isLocalLookingRegExp

> `const` **isLocalLookingRegExp**: `RegExp`

Defined in: [packages/graph/src/alias.ts:52](https://github.com/Xunnamius/projector/blob/7505ea44374986d1d0ddf3a37cdd5d3729450f39/packages/graph/src/alias.ts#L52)

A regex that matches any string that looks like a relative path without also
looking like a bare specifier.

**This regular expression must never have the "global" flag**, meaning it is
safe to use with `.test()`.
