# Variable: isLocalLookingRegExp

> `const` **isLocalLookingRegExp**: `RegExp`

Defined in: [packages/graph/src/alias.ts:51](https://github.com/Xunnamius/projector/blob/5f5f92eca551ebad2a8ed7123cb7ab801a86ad67/packages/graph/src/alias.ts#L51)

A regex that matches any string that looks like a relative path without also
looking like a bare specifier.

**This regular expression must never have the "global" flag**, meaning it is
safe to use with `.test()`.
