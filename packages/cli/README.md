# @projector-js/cli

<!-- TODO -->

- The `--root` argument, when used in a polyrepo context, refers to the
  repository root and can usually be omitted.
- `-w` vs `-p`

> The `p` and alias `projector` command comes from `npm i -g @projector-js/cli`.
> Alternatively, npx can be used: `npx projector ...` (when installed locally)
> or `npx projector-js ...` (when not installed).

glob `-w` has a specific priority order

`create` has alias `init`

`--parallel` vs `--concurrency 1` (or N) vs `--sequential`

confirm when calling `create` within a directory that contains a `package.json`
without `workspaces` key. `--monorepo` (and all other options) settable from
CLI; still, ask via inquirer too.

tests and some other commands are done from root

`clean` command that calls clean script eventually but also cleans up tmp
articles in /tmp and elsewhere

git output symbols inspired by
[https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt][1]

in monorepo mode, publishing from the main repository is not possible

package-id used for git tags

publish will fail if whole repo is not clean

publish will fail if not enough disk space remaining

Caveat: publish command in a monorepo context trades off disk space for perf
(concurrency).

publish will keep temp release dirs around

publish will bind mount `node_modules` and any other files and dirs specified in
`.gitignore`

If going with conventional-changelog, consider using [the CLI version patched to
work properly with monorepos][2]:

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://xunn.at/conventional-changelog-cli
```

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @projector-js/cli
```

## Usage
