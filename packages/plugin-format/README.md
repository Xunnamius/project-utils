# @projector-js/plugin-format

<!-- TODO -->

remark-sort-references

doctoc and remark should ignore whichever files prettier is ignoring (does
prettier have an API to get ignored files? Or do we have to look at
.prettierignore directly). That is: use fast-glob to interpret a shared glob and
then pass the same files to each program.

Needs a special mode where it can run its constituent parts individually based
on the extension of the file passed in. Essentially, it can accept and/or has
internally a lint-staged.config.js style configuration capable of running on
certain formatters

Also the ability to run the individual formatters manually

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @projector-js/plugin-format
```

## Usage

<!-- TODO -->
