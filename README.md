> After the fall
> ([and subsequent rise](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/3121)) of Lerna,
> Projector was my answer to the organizational issues facing my burgeoning
> monorepos and evolved into my personal toolkit for building all sorts of
> projects using monorepos and polyrepos alike. Unfortunately, Projector's scope
> was too ambitious and I didn't have enough time to make
> [the readme file](https://github.com/Xunnamius/project-utils/tree/8c91aaba314cd61db7dbd8478b3d5076be3f48d5)
> a reality.
>
> I've since come to rely on projects like
> [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to fill the void. As for what
> became of Projector, its more interesting components were spun off into
> [project-utils](https://github.com/Xunnamius/project-utils) (this repository),
> [xscripts](https://github.com/Xunnamius/xscripts),
> [xpipeline](https://github.com/Xunnamius/xpipeline), and the
> conventional-changelog and semantic-release forks
> [xchangelog](https://github.com/Xunnamius/xchangelog) and
> [xrelease](https://github.com/Xunnamius/xrelease) (respectively).

- None of the exported functions are async. This is on purpose.
- Note that order matters, and that negated patterns only affect previously
  defined patterns and not future patterns. Given an example.
- The above blockquote should go in the "Appendix" section.
