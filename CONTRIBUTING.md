# Contributing

Hi there! First off, we're thrilled ðŸ¤© you want contribute to this project!

First time contributor to a GitHub project? If you could use some help getting
started, [take a look at this quick and easy
guide][x-external-how-to-contribute]. ðŸ’œ

## Briefly: Submitting a Pull Request (Pr)

> See also: [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][x-repo-code-of-conduct]

This repository uses a [fully automated][x-external-github-actions] [continuous
linting][x-external-husky-cl] (CL), [integration testing][x-repo-gha-ci] (CI),
and [deployment][x-repo-gha-ci] (CD) [projector][x-repo-projector]-based
pipeline for integrating PRs and publishing releases. The neat thing about a
fully automated pipeline is that anyone anywhere can make a contribution quickly
and with minimal tedium.

This repository makes extensive use of [debug][x-external-pkg-debug]. Should you
wish to view all possible debugging output, [export
`DEBUG='*,*:*'`][x-external-pkg-debug-wildcards].

The ideal contributor flow is as follows:

1. [Fork][x-repo-fork] this repository and [clone it
   locally][x-external-how-to-clone].
   - If there is a custom Docker image available for this project and you're
     comfortable with Docker, consider using it instead.
2. Configure and install dependencies with `npm ci`.
   - You use `npm ci` here instead of `npm install` to [prevent unnecessary
     updates to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`][x-external-npm-ci], but
     if it makes more sense to use `npm install` feel free to use that instead.
   - If `.env.example` exists, consider copying it to `.env` and configuring
     sensible defaults.
3. Before making any changes, ensure all unit tests are passing with
   `npm run test`.
4. _(optional but recommended)_ Create a new branch, usually off `main`.
   - Example: `git checkout -b contrib-feature-1`
5. Make your changes and commit. Your work will be checked as you commit; any
   problems will abort the commit/push attempt.
   - Ensure any new tests still pass even when the `DEBUG` environment variable
     is defined (see example above).
6. Push your commits to your fork and, when you're ready, [_fearlessly_ submit
   your PR][x-repo-pr-compare]! Your changes will be tested in our CI pipeline.
7. Pat yourself on the back! Your hard work is well on its way to being reviewed
   and, if everything looks good, merged and released ðŸš€

Additionally, there are a few things you can do to greatly increase the
likelihood your PR passes review:

<details><summary>Expand</summary>

- **Do not** reduce code coverage ([codecov][x-external-codecov] checks are
  performed during CI).
- **Do not** circumvent CL, i.e. automated pre-commit linting, formatting, and
  unit testing.
- **Do not** create a PR to introduce [_purely_ cosmetic
  commits][x-external-cosmetic-commits].
  - Code de-duplication and other potential optimizations we **do not** consider
    _purely_ cosmetic ðŸ™‚
- **Do** [open an issue][x-repo-choose-new-issue] and discuss your proposed
  changes to prevent wasting your valuable time. _Maybe we're already working on
  a fix!_
- **Do** [search][x-repo-open-issues] to see if there are any existing issues
  related to your concerns.
- **Do** practice [atomic committing][x-external-atomic-commits].
- **Do** [follow convention][x-external-conventional-commits] when coming up
  with your commit messages.
- **Do** ensure `README.md` and other documentation that isn't autogenerated is
  kept consistent with your changes.
- **Do** keep your PR as narrow and focused as possible.
  - If you ran `npm install` instead of `npm ci` and it updated `package.json`
    or `package-lock.json` and those updates have nothing to do with your PR
    (e.g. random nested deps were updated), **do not** stage changes to those
    files.
  - If there are multiple related changes to be made but (1) they do not
    immediately depend on one another or (2) one implements extended/alternative
    functionality based on the other, consider submitting them as separate PRs
    instead.
